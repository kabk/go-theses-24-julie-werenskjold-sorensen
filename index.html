			<h3 class="chapter-head" id="intro">Introduction</h3>

			<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
				Let me start out like so many other people with; we live in a fast-pace world bla bla bla - but ehm we
				do, and somewhere along the lines we lost track. We, the human species, are evolving like crazy and
				developing technologies nobody a decade ago could‚Äôve dreamed off (we all still patiently await the
				flying car), but I want to put the human and nature back in focus. The way in which we view the natural
				world has changed drastically, and therefore so has the way in which we think and write about it. The
				Danish book; Ny Jord ‚Äì Tidskrift for Naturkritik (New Earth: Journal of Nature Criticism) by Peter
				Meedom and Jeppe Sengupta Carstensen, came about based on a desire to establish a new critical concept ‚Äì
				Nature Criticism . ‚ÄúThe preconditions for nature criticism, we believe, are once and for all to move
				beyond the idea that human beings and nature are separated or can in any way be kept apart.‚Äù(23). I want
				to add to this conversation by bringing ecofeminism to the table as a hot topic, because just like we
				can‚Äôt separate the human from nature, we can‚Äôt separate women‚Äôs oppression from the domination of
				nature.
			</p>

			<p>
				I will be exploring the evolution of womanhood and the interrelations to the forest as a symbol of
				nature, with focus on the Danish womanhood. The layman term ‚ÄòMother earth‚Äô is throw around usually
				without hesitation, as we speak of the planet we inhabit, yet somewhere down the line, the majority
				forgot what that embodies. The personification of nature is rooted in womanhood, and the life-giving and
				nurturing aspect of nature is embodied in the form of the mother, thereby welding the understanding of
				womanhood and the mother. This type of thinking has deep ties to spirituality, ancestry and the
				collective unconscious, and with the Danes‚Äô mindset turning more and more individualistic, I want to
				allow for a speculative groundwork in order to gain insight into when this deep understanding of the
				entanglement of womanhood and the idea of the enchanted forest started to drift. I am offering an
				insight into the wilderness of my entangled thoughts of the Danish wild womanhood, whilst including
				thoughts on the term ‚Äòwomanhood‚Äô, the personification of Mother Earth, Norse Mythology, The carrier bag
				theory of fiction, the wolf as a symbol of women‚Äôs wilderness, archetypes, the Jelling Dynasty and witch
				hunt in Denmark.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh and let‚Äôs not forget about the Patriarchy ‚Äì that‚Äôs going to be a running theme. Allow me to ask
				questions with no answers, contemplate my own words, contradict my own words, and possibly leave you
				hanging. I‚Äôm just human.

			<h3 class="chapter-head" id="chapter-1">Womanhood and the Collective Unconscious</h3>

			<p style="text-indent: 0px;">
				If you ask me there is no denying that I live in a part of the world which has been designed and curated
				by white men for white men (it being North Europe), and with the western patriarchy walking hand in hand
				with colonialism, deep-rooted marks have been left on a great deal of the world population, and an
				example of this is on how we perceive the meaning of womanhood. It is important to note that my
				observation and judgments are based on my own heritage and upbringing in Denmark . Despite the
				occasional (read; widespread) ignorance - or as Carl Jung calls it; our collective unconscious, which
				boils down to; being the believe that a part of the mind contains memories and impulse which are based
				on archetypal personalities that are universal symbols, which represent common human experiences and
				emotions (1). The idea of this being that the individual is not aware off these instincts. To this day,
				we tend to disregard our ancestral experiences as sources of knowledge and guidance. Whether this sense
				of collective unconscious is something we are born with according to Jung or as John Locke argues;
				something which we are ‚Äòtaught‚Äô in our upbringing after birth (2), will not be the focus of this
				speculative piece (how saying is it that this debate was established by white men (18)? Just sayin‚Äô).
				However, the focus on their studies of the archetypes and ancestral experiences as sources of knowledge
				and guidance will be.
			</p>

			<p>
				Womanhood: by definition is ‚Äúthe state or condition of being a woman, the qualities considered to be
				natural to or characteristics of a woman, and women considered collectively‚Äù (3). But what does it mean
				to be a woman? ‚ÄúAn adult female human being.‚Äù ‚Äì great thanks google‚Ä¶ This is where some believe we could
				enter clouded waters, because what does it mean to be female? I choose to reject the definition by
				google. The aim of this is not discussing sex, gender, binary and the non-binary, however in order to
				understand the viewpoint of this writing it is important that we have a mutual understanding ‚Äì between
				author and reader ‚Äì that womanhood, and the feeling of being a woman does not have to do with what is
				defined as biological sex. The focus here is on the oppressed women ‚Äì not only females, however the base
				of research that ground the stereotypes which well be explored have been based on women with wombs. It
				is an effort to reclaim the mean of women, in this case, in the context of the forest.
			<p>
				Mother Earth or Mother Nature. There are countless of examples of cultures and Mythologies, which have
				an Earth Goddess or God, however a red thread is that the Earth is most commonly depicted as a Goddess.
				A woman. To name a few; the Akan Mythology, Asase Ya, also known as Abrewa Akan, meaning old lady, is an
				ancient religious figure worshiped by the indigenous people of Guinea coast. She also represents
				procreation, truth, love, fertility, peace and the land of Akan (9). In Sumerian Mythology, Nihursag is
				the mother of Goddess, Gods and Mother of Men for her part in creating both divine and mortal entities
				(10). In Norse Mythology, although not mentioned often in stories, the mother of Thor; J√∂r√∞ old Norse
				for soil/earth, is the personification and Goddess of earth. And we can of course not forget about the
				The Goddess Gaia from Greek Mythology, called, the mother earth or the earth moth (12), and there are
				many more out there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nature, the word itself, is derived from the Latin word natura, which in ancient archetype of the mother
				is a natural caretaker, maintaining and sustaining life through emotional, physical and spiritual
				support, healing and nurturing. ‚Äú‚Ä¶considered to be natural to or characteristics of a woman,‚Ä¶‚Äù (3).
				Putting two and two together, there is little to no room of escaping the metaphor of Mother Nature. Due
				to the entanglement of womanhood and the mother, we can‚Äôt view one subjectively without the other,
				motherhood follows the lead of womanhood, however it is not what it means to be a woman.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let‚Äôs take a trip far back in time, to visit our friends Adam and Eve, the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù human couple, from
				the Old Testament, one of the many books which supposably embodies the answers to all life ‚Äì the ick.
				The most of us knows the story; Eve couldn‚Äôt stand the temptation of the forbidden fruit of the tree of
				knowledge of good and evil and gave in after the devil disguised as a serpent, started encouraging her,
				followed not long after by Adam. When oh middy God found out ‚Äòhe‚Äô felt it fair to send the couple from
				the Garden of Eden into the world. ‚ÄòHe‚Äô punished the female body with bearing children, excruciating
				pain at childbirth (also called labor), and the male with the oh so very labor (ironic) intensive of
				grooming of the ‚Äòaccursed‚Äô grounds (Earth) (4). Some argue this was the birth of the patriarchy we live
				in now. But whether we choose to believe the stories of the bible or not, there have been people on
				earth for thousands of years, and we are brought up to believe the first tool of humankind was the
				spear. The tool of hunting and killing. The commonly accepted fact: a male hero , bringing home the pray
				and the gasp worthy story of the hunt. In her text The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction, Ursula K. Le Guin
				offers a rewrite of ‚Äòour‚Äô narrative by proposing that the first tool was a shell, a net, a ling, a sack,
				a bottle, a pot, a holder. A recipient ‚Äì A bag. This is narrative also toggles the stereotypical role of
				importance of the source of survival, putting the gathering and harvesting as the stable source of life
				in comparison to the meat, thereby offering the narrative of humankind as gathers and harvesters rather
				than hunters and killers. I choose to reject the killer story and embrace the slow story, the steady
				story, the part of the story which offers the recipient as the source of survival. The narrative of the
				gatherers.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a crucial toggle of our narrative, as the hunters were typically men and gathers were women,
				meaning we change the story of survival based on the man and turn our focus to the women. A narrative
				which has been neglected for too long and left marks in women around the world. ‚ÄúThe trouble is, we‚Äôve
				all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is
				with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold
				one, the life story.‚Äù (16, p 2). The relation of womanhood and nature is a bond we cannot neglect, yet
				that is exactly what many of us have done for centuries. We have become greatly separated from our
				ancestors from back when we were a group of gathers, and this is a mark which is rooted deeply within
				us. How is it women have played such crucial roles of survival, and that the exact skill of gathering
				and harvesting, was eventually what went on to be one of the causes for mass-hysteria and the witch
				hunts through Europe? And where does it leave us now? Stay tuned because we are far from done, but
				before entering the era off witchcraft, let‚Äôs go even further back in time; back to the Middle Ages, the
				Norsemen ‚Äì the Vikings.
