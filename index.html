				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Let me start out like so many others; we live in a fast-paced world bla bla bla - but ehm we do, and somewhere
					down the path we diverted without looking up. We are evolving like crazy and developing technologies nobody
					could‚Äôve dreamed off (we all (still) patiently await the flying car), but I want to back up. Disregard the good
					and the bad of technologies and put human and nature back in focus. The way we view nature has changed
					drastically, and so has the way we think and write about it. The Danish book <em>Ny Jord ‚Äì Tidskrift for
					  Naturkritik (New Earth: Journal of Nature Criticism)</em> by Peter Meedom and Jeppe Sengupta Carstensen, came
					about based on a desire to establish a new critical concept ‚Äì <span>Nature Criticism</span><span

						id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Nature Criticism: A concept of criticism which
						explores the link between humans and nature as inseparable entities.
						<br />
					  </span></span><em>. ‚ÄúThe preconditions for nature criticism, we believe, are once and for all to move beyond the
					  idea that human beings and nature are separated or can in any way be kept apart.‚Äù</em>(23). I want to add to
					this conversation by bringing <span>ecofeminism</span> <span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1"
						class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span
						class="sidenote">Ecofeminism: a branch of¬†feminism which examines the connections between women and nature.
						Its name was coined by French feminist Fran√ßoise d‚ÄôEaubonne in 1974. Ecofeminism uses the basic feminist
						tenets of equality¬†between genders, a revaluing of non-patriarchal or nonlinear structures, and a view of the
						world that respects organic processes,¬†holistic connections, and the merits of intuition¬†and collaboration
						(Miles, Kathryn.).
						<br />
					
					</span></span> to the table as a hot topic, because just like we can‚Äôt separate the human from nature, we can‚Äôt
					separate women‚Äôs oppression from the domination of nature.</p>
				  <p>I will be exploring the evolution of womanhood and the interrelations to the forest as a symbol of nature, with
					focus on the Danish womanhood. ‚ÄòMother earth‚Äô is throw around usually without hesitation, yet somehow the majority
					of us forgot what that embodies. The personification of nature is rooted in womanhood, and the life-giving and
					nurturing aspect of nature is embodied in the form of the mother, thereby welding the understanding of womanhood
					and the mother. This type of thinking has deep ties to spirituality, ancestry and the collective unconscious, and
					with the Danes‚Äô mindset turning more and more individualistic, I want to allow for a speculative groundwork to
					gain insight into when this deep understanding of the entanglement of womanhood and the enchanted forest started
					to drift. I am offering an insight into the wilderness of my entangled thoughts of the Danish wild womanhood,
					whilst including thoughts on the term ‚Äòwomanhood‚Äô, the personification of Mother Earth, Norse Mythology, The
					carrier bag theory of fiction, a look back into the Danish monarchy, the witch-hunts, and the wolf as a symbol of
					women‚Äôs wilderness.</p>
				  
					<p>Oh and let‚Äôs not forget about the <span>Patriarchy</span><span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2"
						class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span
						class="sidenote">Patriarchy both refers to the greater aggregate power that men have over women and further
						genders‚Äîsocial, political, economic‚Äîas well as power hierarchies between individual men and groups of men,
						including trans men (Strid, Sofia, and Jeff Hearn.).
						<br />
					  </span></span> ‚Äì that‚Äôs going to be a running theme. Along the way many terms will be defined to assure we are
					on the same path, for this I have relied on encyclopedia. Allow me to ask questions with no answers, contemplate
					and contradict my own words, and possibly leave you hanging. I‚Äôm just human.</p>

				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">We live in a part of the world which has been designed and curated by white men for white men (it being North
				Europe), and with the western patriarchy walking hand in hand with colonialism, deep-rooted marks have been left
				on a great deal of the world<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-3"

					class="sidenote">Additionally noting that there are matrilineal societies in the world to this day which have
					not been deeply westernized. (Nelson, Camilla.).
					<br />
				  </span></span>. An example is how we perceive the meaning of womanhood. It is important to note that my
				observation and judgments are based on my own heritage and upbringing in Denmark. Despite the occasional (read;
				widespread) ignorance, or as Carl Jung calls it; collective unconscious, which is the believe that a part of the
				mind contains memories and impulse which are based on archetypal personalities that are universal symbols,
				representing common human experiences and emotions (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica.). The idea being that
				the individual is not aware off these instincts. To this day, we tend to disregard our ancestral experiences as
				sources of knowledge and guidance and whether this sense of collective unconscious is something we are born with
				according to Jung or as John Locke argues; something which we are ‚Äòtaught‚Äô(Main, Paul.), will not be the focus
				(how saying is it that this debate was established by white men (18)?). Their studies of the archetypes and
				ancestral experiences as sources of knowledge and guidance will be.</p>

				</span>


				<p>Womanhood is <em>‚Äúthe state or condition of being a woman, the qualities considered to be natural to or
				  characteristics of a woman, and women considered collectively‚Äù</em> (3). But what does it mean to be a woman?
				<em>‚ÄúAn adult female human being.‚Äù</em> ‚Äì great thanks google‚Ä¶ Now this is a dirty old puddle, because what does
				it mean to be female? I choose to reject the definition of female provided by google. The aim of this is not
				discussing sex, gender, binary and the non-binary, however it is crucial we have mutual understanding ‚Äì between
				author and reader ‚Äì that womanhood, and the feeling of being a woman does not have to do with what is defined as
				biological sex. The focus is on the oppressed women ‚Äì not only females, however the base of research that ground
				the stereotypes which will be explored have been based on women with wombs. This is an effort to reclaim the mean
				of women and womanhood.</p>
			  
				<p>Mother Earth or Mother Nature. There are countless of examples of cultures and Mythologies, which have an Earth
				Goddess. A woman. To name a few; the Akan Mythology, Asase Ya, also known as Abrewa, in Sumerian Mythology;
				Nihursag, the Goddess Gaia from Greek Mythology, and in Norse Mythology, although not mentioned often in stories,
				the mother of Thor; J√∂r√∞ old Norse for soil/earth.</p>
			
				<p>The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, which in ancient times meant ‚Äúbirth‚Äù, what who - generally
				speaking - gives birth? The mother. The archetype of the mother is a natural caretaker, maintaining and sustaining
				life through emotional, physical and spiritual support, healing and nurturing. There is little to no room of
				escaping the metaphor of Mother Nature. We can‚Äôt view either womanhood or the mother subjectively without the
				other due to their entanglement. Motherhood follows the lead of womanhood; however, it is not what it means to be
				a woman.</p>
			
				<p>Let‚Äôs take a trip back in time to our friends Eve and Adam, the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù human couple. The most of us knows the
				story; Eve ate the apple (correction; forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge and good and evil - pardon me)
				because the serpent convinced her (stupid snake), and Adam followed not long after. When God found out ‚Äòhe‚Äô felt
				it fair to send the couple from the Garden of Eden into the world. ‚ÄòHe‚Äô punished the female body with bearing
				children, excruciating pain at childbirth (also called labor), and the male with the oh so very labor (ironic)
				intensive work of grooming of the ‚Äòaccursed‚Äô grounds (Earth). Some argue this was the birth of the patriarchy. But
				whether we choose to believe the stories of the bible or not, there have been people on earth for thousands of
				years, and we are brought up to believe the first tool of humankind was the spear. The tool of hunting and
				killing. The commonly accepted fact: a male hero<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4"
					class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span
					class="sidenote">The hero archetype is a character who acts as a force or the greater good, defending those
					weaker than themselves to the point of self sacrifice. They‚Äôre usually elevated above those around them in
					some way, whether that‚Äôs through a superpower or magical advantage, or through an exemplary personal trait
					such as great courage or compassion (Callaghan, Fija.).
					<br />
				  </span></span>, bringing home the pray and the gasp worthy story of the hunt. In her text <em>The Carrier Bag
				  Theory of Fiction</em>, Ursula K. Le Guin offers a rewrite of our narrative by proposing that the first tool was
				a holder, a recipient ‚Äì a bag. This theory questions the stereotypical role of survival, offering the narrative of
				humankind as gathers and harvesters rather than hunters and killers, meaning we change the story of survival based
				on the man and turn our focus to the women. I choose to reject the killer story and embrace the slow story, the
				steady story, the part of the story which offers the recipient as the source of survival. The narrative of the
				gatherers.</p>
			  
				<p>A narrative which has been neglected for too long and left marks in women around the world. ‚Äú<em>The trouble is,
				  we‚Äôve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. Hence it is
				  with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the
				  life story</em>.‚Äù (16, p 2). The relation of womanhood and nature is a bond we cannot neglect, yet that is
				exactly what many of us have done for centuries. We have become greatly separated from our ancestors, lost
				connection to the forest and the marks are feelings of emptiness I believe we seek fulfilment within. How is it
				women have played such crucial roles of survival, and that the exact skill of gathering and harvesting, was
				eventually what went on to be one of the causes for mass-hysteria and the witch hunts through Europe? And where
				does it leave us now? Stay tuned because we are far from done, but let‚Äôs go even further back in time; back to the
				Middle Ages, the Norsemen ‚Äì the Vikings.</p>

			</h3>
			
				<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Before Christianity entered the waters of North, it was complex mythological Gods and Goddesses from the Norse
					Mythology which guided the people of the Viking era (McCoy, Daniel.). The myths serving as the fundament of the
					belief, were communicated through odes<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5"
						class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span

						class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-6" class="margin-toggle" /><span
						class="sidenote">The word itself means ‚Äòstory‚Äô, ‚Äòtale‚Äô or ‚Äòhistory‚Äô and normally refers specifically to the
						epid prose narratives written mainly in Iceland between the 12th and 15th century CE, covering the country‚Äôs
						history as well as Scandinavia‚Äôs past.
						<br />
					  </span></span>, and passed down through our ancestors through tales and stories. Very little of the Germanic
					writing has survived, and as of now the knowledge is primary based on two works called the Prose Edda<span
					  class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
						id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The Prose Edda was written between 1222-23, after the

						class="sidenote">The Poetic Edds is a manuscript which dates back to the second half of the 13th century,

						<br />
					  </span></span>, which were written after the Christianization ‚Äì so just exactly how unbiased the work is I leave
					up to you to judge. The believers of Norse mythology saw the world as enchanted, there was no need to seek
					salvation, but instead found peace living with nature, the enchanted forest and its spirits. Today, as the
					population grows, many people seek the city high. The closest we get to living in an enchanted forest is the
					little walk we take to ‚Äòease our minds‚Äô or our domesticated house plants which are usually not very native to the
					country, I mean who doesn‚Äôt know someone with a monstera living in the corner of their living rooms? (guilty as
					charged).</p>

					</span>
				  
					<p>The Swedes and Norwegians have the alps and their never-ending forests, where folklore and fairytales are still
					thriving, and spreading fairy dust, and what does the Danish nature have to offer? Where is the fairy dust? In my
					humble opinion - Denmark does not have nature which can measure up to our neighbors. With forests which have
					either been turned into agricultural land or home for pigs, and what has been ‚Äòleft‚Äô has been suffocated from all
					mystery and magic and turned into grounds controlled by human. Even the most ‚Äòwild looking‚Äô areas of the forest
					have been tampered with, whether this is to optimize the growth of a certain wood type or to storm secure, every
					bit of the ‚Äòwild‚Äô of Denmark, is far from wild. Hunters are still hunting, but where are the gathers? Where are
					the women?</p>
				 
					<p>There is a danger of acknowledging dualism between women‚Äôs oppression and the domination of nature (Plumwood,
					Val.), because by neglecting the dependency on nature, one also neglects the narrative of the gatherer. Women
					became further oppressed and our enchanted forests lost its magic through domestication. This is not an issue
					specifically to Denmark, is it a worry throughout the world, Denmark is just such a beautiful example.
					Additionally, to the beforehand accepted killer narrative, let‚Äôs revisit Eve and Adam.</p>
				 
					<p>Marked in King Harald Bluetooth‚Äôs Runestone from 965, he declared the Danes Christian (‚ÄúChristianity Comes to
					Denmark.‚Äù). Changing how we view the world is gradual and doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, and the first Christian
					mission dates to around 710 from the 6<sup>th</sup> century to the late 10<sup>th</sup> century, Christianity
					found a way to gradually co-exist with the Nordic Gods. Adam and Even in the world of enchanted forests and
					spirits, Goddesses and God(s). Overtime Christianity pushed out the spirits, and people started to seek salvation
					from the churches, a new path was carved out for people to follow. We seek validation and acceptance, especially
					from the people around us, so no wonder being able to go to someone for forgivingness was inviting. Along with the
					patriarchy our need for community and acceptance was found within the churches, and our ancestorial connection to
					the land started to drift. Spirits became tales told at night rather than a deeply rooted believe system.</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 0px;" >Not only is the Danish Kingdom one of the oldest in Europe, but it‚Äôs also the second oldest in the world, with a
				backup from the population bigger than ever before (Maybe because the ruling monarch for the past 52 years was
				Margrete the 2<sup>nd</sup>, a woman. But hey what do I know). In 1387, the first ruling Queen was appointed,
				Margrete the 1<sup>st</sup>, she unified Denmark, Norway and Sweden by the union of Kalmar, but recent discoveries
				found that she might not have been the first influential Queen of Denmark. Spinning the clock back the gruesome
				actions we now know as tales of the Vikings, we meet Gorm the Old and Queen Thyra<span
				class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
				id="sn-9" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Interesting to point out is the fact that Harald
				Bluetooth was the son of Gorm and Thyra.
				<br />
				</span></span> who came to power around 936. The discourse of the regent couple has till this point placed Gorm
				as the man in charge, however new research suggest that Thyra had far more power and influence than previously
				thought, suggesting what we thought was fact might‚Äôve been factoid<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label
				for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-10"
				class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Factoid is an item of¬†unreliable information that is reported
				and repeated so often that it becomes accepted as fact.
				<br />
				</span></span>. In reality, we don‚Äôt know much with certainty about Gorm. Eleventh-century historian Adam of
				Bremen suggests he was a ‚ÄòStranger King‚Äô from Norway or Normandy. The late twelfth-century historians Sven Aggesen
				and Saxo Grammaticus have described Gorm‚Äôs as weak and lazy, whereas the Norwegian sagas believes him to be a
				talented warrior (Imer, Lisbeth, et al.). What we know is questionable because the main documentation we have from
				their time are 250 runestones. And don‚Äôt get me wrong; there are many but not a whole bible worth of rocks, but
				the text sure is set in stone.</p>
			  
				<p>The research article published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications Ltd., is based
				on a deep analysis of the runestones, by utilizing 3D scanning to study carving techniques through rhythm,
				combined with geographical distribution, orthography and language usage. ‚Äú<em>The mentioning of Thyra on no fewer
				than four runestones is unparalleled in Viking-Age Denmark. In comparison, it is remarkable that Gorm is named
				on only a single stone ‚Äî and there accompanied by Thyra. Not even her famous son, Harald Bluetooth</em><span
				class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
				id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Some say he was the first King of Denmark due to
				uncertainty of the area which Gorm ruled over, however others classify him as the second King of
				Denmark.
				<br />
				 </span></span><em>, is mentioned on that many stones.‚Äù</em> (Imer, Lisbeth, et al.). To my understanding the
				objective has been to establish a greater likelihood that the Thyra mentioned on the four runestones was indeed
				the same and not two different women. It makes me wonder; why has it been so hard to accept conspiracy of it being
				the same women in the first place? If one side thinks Gorm was lousy lazy person and the other a brave warrior,
				but we just accept the fact that he was ‚Äòin charge‚Äô, why has it seemed too distant to hypothesis a woman with
				great influence? Hypothetical, potential answer; the patriarchy. It seems very plausible that women of power have
				been written out of history to make space for the hero. I believe it is about the discourse of what we choose to
				accept, and if we choose to accept the runestones as <em>‚Äúgranite manifestation of status, lineage and power, we
				may suggest that Thyra was indeed of royal, Jutlandic descent.‚Äù</em> (Imer, Lisbeth, et al.). This allowed for
				reconsideration of the role of the elite Viking women who possible have held significant political power, and as
				Lisbeth M. Imer, researcher and author with specialism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance says; <em>"we shouldn't
				rule out the possibility of women being able to hold power in their own right.".</em></p>
			  
				<p>As exciting this is for Denmark‚Äôs history, women having the right to own land is not exactly news. One thing
				which persists today is the idea that to sit on a big fortune you rely on a workforce: introducing Feudalism<span
				class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
				id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Feudalism was¬†a system where people were given land
				and protection by people of higher rank and worked and fought for them in as payment.

				</span></span>, serfdom<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13"
				class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span
				class="sidenote">Serfdom is different compared to slavery. Serfs were no traded or sold like property the way
				slaves were. Serfs were legally bound to the land they worked on, and only if the land was traded amongst
				lords did the serf shift ‚Äúowner‚Äù/employer.
				<br />
				</span></span> and Dena lagu¬†aka the Danelaw. From around 800, the Vikings were raiding the coastlines of
				Britain and Ireland with the intentions of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England. Concurring great
				areas of land the ruling law became the Danelaw, whether what I am about to tell you was Anglo-Saxon law before or
				after the Danelaw, I am uncertain off; however, it is referred to as the Anglo-Saxon law and it allowed for women
				serfs to rule ‚Äòtheir own‚Äô land (Federici, Silvia.). This does not mean men and women were seen as equals, the
				owner/employer/lord of the land the women ‚Äòowned‚Äô had the authority to control their lives, both in terms of work
				and marriage ‚Äì to be a woman in a patriarchal society (Federici, Silvia.). Gatherers but domesticated.</p>
			  
				<p>It is remarkable that Denmark‚Äôs existence and big political moves, could very well be due to two women. Margete
				the 1<sup>st</sup> unified the Kalmar Union, and if we choose to believe these new findings as our new narrative
				and discourse it means that Queen Thyra, played a great role ‚Äì if not THE role ‚Äì in the unification of kingdoms of
				land into the kingdom of Denmark. Having women of the elite have the ability to own land is nothing new in Western
				Europe, however now Denmark can be added on the list of areas where this ruling was plausible. We ‚Äòknow‚Äô that Gorm
				was said to be a stranger King, and it is believed Thyra was from what we now know as Denmark, so could it be that
				she was a woman of great power before Gorm? That their joint forces and her status put Gorm in the position of
				being King? We can only hypothesis, however given how much is based on hypothesis and here say, this is
				groundbreaking in terms of the women‚Äôs influence, and which has never been considered or taken seriously.</p>
			 
				<p>A narrative filled with savages, looting and killing, a time in history of the hero narrative thriving, but now
				we claim space for women to be written into our history. This does not mean that the narrative of the gatherers
				does not remain for the common folk, after all the spirits and the enchanted forest was still there. But let me
				hypothesis; in order to compete with the elite domination of the hero, the mother has had to hide ‚Äì disregard the
				narrative of the gatherer, disregard the longing for the enchanted forest ‚Äì put themselves in a position of
				authority, and if authority is man, then how do we rewrite the narrative so strongly imposed for the position of
				the woman? The elite woman claims space, already in a position of authority, allowing protection, compared to the
				common woman ‚Äì this does not by any means mean it was easy. Besides from the authority of the mother (or more so
				the marriage, because who during that time dared to give birth without a husband!?), how does one tackle the
				authority of the hero? Being a woman with a voice often ‚Äì to this day ‚Äì lands you in the stereotypes of loud,
				obnoxious and irritating, yet somehow it seems that we have made no archetype for ‚Äòthat‚Äô type of person. But ‚Äòwe‚Äô
				sure have found a word we like to use: Hysteria.</p>
			  
				<p>Hysteria has a loaded history - worthy a whole thesis - and has been used as a tool to control women‚Äôs behavior
				and bodies, causing countless misdiagnoses and violent mishandling of trauma throughout our time. The Danish
				vocabulary even has a word for the so called ‚Äòhysterical women‚Äô: hystade, which to this day is still used
				derogatorily towards women. Hysteria comes from the Greek <em>Hystera</em> which means womb, and originally was
				defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus
				(‚ÄúHysteria | Etymology of Hysteria by Etymonline.‚Äù) . Individuals with womb have a very different human cycle
				compared to individuals without wombs, to be more precise; an individual with a womb has a natural hormonal cycle
				of about 28 days, and an individual without a womb? 24 hours (Verhofstede, Rebecca.). So let me paint you a
				picture; one which might not be fully scientifically correct but it‚Äôs where my logic takes me; if being moody and
				irritable is only a percentage of the cycle, that means womb carriers can have a mood swing which can last though
				a couple of days where for none-womb carriers, it might just be a hot minute and then we move on. No wonder men
				didn‚Äôt know what was going on, there was after all very little womb carrier voices being heard, so to diagnose
				women with the ‚Äòissue‚Äô of literally being a woman, probably seemed very legit from their perspective.</p>
			 
				<p>Let‚Äôs jump straight into the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century. An era of mass-hysteria; The witch trials which
				haunted through Europe, and Denmark was no exception. This is a one of many pivotal moments for woman. As a
				society which have survived based on gatherers and harvesters, the patriarchy found a way of scaring women out the
				forest. In 1617, King Christian the 4<sup>th</sup>, prohibited all types of magic, both black magic and white
				magic by deeming practicing a crime and all Danes had the responsibility to raise trials (God, Vikash.). Based on
				the documentation what we have around 1,000 people were killed for conspiracy to practicing witchcrafts, and I
				believe along with the witch hunts died the thousands of years of gathering knowledge which has been passed down
				through generations. An educated woman of her time might‚Äôve been great at harvesting and gathering herbs for
				different purposes and I would not have been surprised if that was the exact women who were first in line as for
				the witch trials. This haunt is gruesome in so many ways which would never be fully comprehendible to this day,
				and yet as we speak about it, we forget to address the years back it put women into society. I believe that it is
				in this time of history in the west, where it becomes far beyond reasonable doubt to hypothesis that the
				oppression of women and domination of the forest is due to the patriarchy. This is the pivotal in which women were
				further domesticated. The fear of setting foot in the forest, the fear of looking the wrong way at a damn plant
				might still be in us to this day? My hypothesis is that women kept away from the forest in fear, and this bound
				them to the four walls of the ones lucky enough to have a roof over their heads, and if this does not fall in
				under the definition of domesticated, I simply do not know what does. And the forest you might ask? Well without
				the women to tell the fairytale stores and share the slow narrative of the gatherers, we were left with the
				hunters. The hero. The brutal stories of the hunt, and the forest became a space of wild animals deemed to either
				be killed or domesticated, either way, it left both the animals and the wilderness at the hands of mankind. The
				few that did wander out into the forest to care for their land most likely made sure to never mention the power of
				the herbs around them too loudly ever again.</p>

				<span class="mobile-only-text">Chapter 4 - The wild woman and a wolf hunt</span>
			</h3>

			<p style="text-indent: 0px;">Let‚Äôs have a look at something a little more resent than the 17<sup>th</sup> century, introducing the revival of
				an archetype - first introduced by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s in 1992 in her book <em>‚ÄúWomen who run with the
				  wolves‚Äù.</em> The wild woman. She is the embodiment of the instinctual, wild and intuitive aspect of the women.
				A powerful source, creativity, spontaneity, courageous, sensual, unapologetic, untamed and with a deep connection
				of nature. She is the woman many of us have been taught to be afraid of. The independent fairytale like women
				society has deemed as mythical creatures. An empowered wild woman is a force, great strength, embodiment of honest
				conversation, communication and action. She is a woman who has untangled herself from the patriarchy‚Äôs norms and
				reconnected and relearnt to follow her own intuition, power and wisdom within. Wild is to be understood in the
				context of a women who has a strong connection with the natural environment, her instincts and has escaped
				domestication. I choose the words ‚Äòrevival of an archetype‚Äô because I believe there has been such women around
				throughout time, and we have been suppressing them through generations.</p>
			
				<p>Pinkola Est√©s compares the wild women to wolves and argues that we share similar autonomy. ‚Äú<em>They are
				experiences in adapting to constantly changing circumstances; they are fiercely stalwart and very brave. Yet
				both have been hounded, harassed and falsely imputed to be devouring and devious, overly aggressive, or less
				valye than those who are their detractors. They have been targeted of those who would clean up the wilds as well
				as the wildish environs of the psyche, extincting the instinctual, leaving no trace of it behind</em>.‚Äù
				Ironically enough we killed the last wolf in the Danish forests back in 1824, and by doing so we eliminated the
				only true wild thread to humanity on the Danish land (not counting the colonial land), besides from falling trees
				and our fellow humans<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-14"
				class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-14" class="margin-toggle" /><span
				class="sidenote">I would almost categorize this as common knowledge of Danes that keep a little up to date ‚Äì
				It was almost impossible not to hear about the ‚Äú199 years since they have been there!?‚Äù narrative in the news
				back in 2023.
				<br />
				</span></span>. By doing so we put mankind at the top of the rank and empowered the image of the hunter. The
				hero. The man. After the women were forced from the deep connection to the forest, it was a wild place for a
				while. A hunting ground. But it wasn‚Äôt long till the hunters felt the need to tame the forest and turn the wild
				into land filled with resources, with no thread besides from ourselves. So, the wolf ‚Äòhad‚Äô to go. Suddenly the
				forest became a resource. The magical ideology of the wild forest was gone. There was no wilderness besides from
				plant vegetation and the fox. - possibly also a snake or two, but there were no bigger threads to our life and
				society. If there is no thread from nature we seem to lack respect. It isn‚Äôt until we are faced with fear we tread
				carefully.</p>
			 
				<p>But just like the revival of the wild woman the wolf is returning to Denmark. In 2023 the first wolf was sighted,
				and as of now approximately 30 live freely in the Danish forests. Let this be a sign of the returning wild woman
				within us, and let‚Äôs embrace the autonomy of decision making. Relearn to trust our intuition and instincts as
				women in a society where we for generations have been told to do the opposite. As humans we seek patterns, we seek
				understanding and recognition within others, we seek a pack. Whether we are choosing to accept and get in touch
				with the wilderness within ourselves we are all pack animals that seek comfort and an escape from the fear of
				loneliness. It‚Äôs so deep in our instincts to seek a pack in order for a better chance of survival, but can a lone
				wolf thrive? No, but it can survive well on its own until it finds the right pack.</p>

			<p style="text-indent: 0px;" >Is there a way in which we can learn to lose the connection between womanhood and hysteria? Can we turn our
				collective unconscious, conscious, and acknowledge the lack of understanding of women behavior? Can we introduce
				new archetypes which have yet to be accepted into our conscious? Maybe it is more a matter of connection with the
				understanding of our inner selves. You don‚Äôt have to go roll in dirt, heck you don‚Äôt have to hug a tree, but have
				you tried? A lil tree huggin‚Äô never hurt anybody. Seek comfort from the collective of womanhood. Find your pack of
				people. There is a way in which we can find comfort within ourselves, what exact way this is I cannot tell you ‚Äì
				it is something broader than either of us. I believe truly only you can be the judge of what this means to you,
				whether you are the carrier of a womb or not.</p>
			 
				<p>The discourse of how we have understood the position of women through time has to change, and if we are to enter
				into conversation about nature criticism, the lack of acknowledgement between the ties of womanhood and nature has
				to be brought out from the deep dark area of neglect and into the light in order to elevate our conversations. It
				is a matter of allowing space for a new way of thinking and hypothesizing about how we behave as humans. A way of
				thinking which is not gendered, one which allows both the ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô and the ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô to take part. It will
				have to do with a cultural shift of reclaiming meaning, and challenge commonly accepted definitions and facts.
				Language is ever evolving so can‚Äôt ‚Äòfacts‚Äô be ever evolving too? Can we find a way of disconnecting the masculine
				with male and feminine with female or are we beyond the point of no return in more than one way?</p>
			  
				<p>The goal is to move towards a normalization of the autonomy of choice of behavior without the fear of judgement
				and neglect. Disregarding the gender norms and break way with the harsh shell of protection which we seek cover
				within and understand the narrative of the gatherers. We are in need of a seriously good paradigm shift (if not
				multiple) in order to move above the archetypes which currently brew in our collective un/conscious.</p>
