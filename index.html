					<p>Let me start out like so many others; we live in a fast-paced world bla bla bla. We diverted from
						the path without
						looking up, technology took off, yet somehow we still patiently await the flying car. I want to
						disregard the good
						and the bad of technology, go back to before we diverted, and put human and nature back in
						focus.</p>

					<p>The Danish book <em>Ny Jord ‚Äì Tidskrift for Naturkritik (New Earth: Journal of Nature
							Criticism)</em> by Peter
						Meedom and Jeppe Sengupta Carstensen, came to life based on a desire to establish a new critical
						concept ‚Äì Nature
						Criticism<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
								&#x261E;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span
								class="sidenote">Nature Criticism explored the
								connection between humans and nature, whilst viewing the two as inseparable entities.
								<br />
							</span></span>. <em>‚ÄúThe preconditions for nature criticism, we believe, are once and for
							all to move beyond the
							idea that human beings and nature are separated or can in any way be kept apart.‚Äù</em>
						(Meedom). I want to add to this conversation by bringing
						ecofeminism<span class="sidenote-wrapper"> &#x261E;<label for="sn-1"
								class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"
								class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ecofeminism is a branch of feminism which
								examines the
								connection between women and nature. Its name was first coined in 1974 by French
								feminist Fran√ßoise d‚ÄôEaubonne.
								It used the basic feminist tenets of equality between genders, a revaluing of
								non-patriarchal or nonlinear
								structures, and a view of the world that respects organic processes, holistic
								connections, and the merit of
								intuition and collaboration (Miles).
								<br />
							</span></span> to the table as a hot topic, because just like we can‚Äôt separate the human
						from nature, we can‚Äôt
						separate women‚Äôs oppression from the domination of nature.</p>

					<p>‚ÄòMother Nature‚Äô is thrown around without hesitation, yet somehow down the line we forgot what
						that embodies. The
						personification of nature has deep roots entangled with the image of the Mother, and within the

							</span></span> the understanding of womanhood and the mother has been welded together. This
						type of thinking has
						ties to our culture, our ancestry and the Collective Unconscious, and with the Danes‚Äô mindset
						turning more and more

						evolution of womanhood
						and the interrelations to the enchanted forest. With the forest as a symbol of nature, I will
						focus on the Danish
						landscape, with the aim of understanding when this deep entanglement started to drift apart.
						Through historical
						roots, mythology, Queens of the Monarchy, Hysteria, and a nationwide wolf hunt I will offer a
						brief insight into the
						wilderness of my entangled thoughts of the Danish wild womanhood. <span class="spirit">Who is she?</span></p>

						<p>We live in a part of the world designed and curated by white men for white men (Northern
							Europe), and with western
							patriarchy tightly knit with colonialism, deep-rooted marks have been left on a great deal
							of the world<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4"
									class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> &#x261E;</label><input type="checkbox"
									id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Whilst still noting there
									are
									matrilineal societies in
									the world to this day which have not been deeply westernized (Nelson).
									<br />
								</span></span>. An example is how we perceive the meaning of womanhood, despite the
							occasional (read; widespread)
							ignorance, or as Carl Jung calls it; our Collective Unconscious. Which is the theory that a
							part of the mind
							contains memories and impulses, which are based on archetypical personalities that are
							perceived as universal
							symbols and representations of the common human experiences and emotions (The Editors of
							Encyclopedia Britannica).
							Key here is the unawareness of these instincts, which correlates well with the ideas that
							tend to disregard our
							ancestral experiences as sources of knowledge, <span class="spirit">a sense of guidance
								through the wild world.</span></p>

						<p>Languages, cultures and mythologies have through centuries personified Earth and Nature via
							the portrayal of the
							Mother and/or Goddesses<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5"
									class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> &#x261E;</label><input type="checkbox"
									id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">To name a few; the Akan
									Mythology,
									Asase Ya, also known as Abrewa, in Sumerian Mythology;
									Nihursag, the Goddess Gaia from Greek Mythology, and in Norse Mythology, although
									not mentioned often in
									stories, the mother of Thor and Odin; J√∂r√∞ old Norse for soil/earth.
									<br />
								</span></span>. <span class="spirit">She flows through the trees, dances in the air,
								nurtures the ground and kisses your cheek with a
								breeze.</span> Coincidentally the word nature is derived from the Latin <em>natura</em>,
							which in ancient times meant
							<em>birth</em>. The characteristic of the Mother archetype is nurturing, life-giving, a
							natural caretaker, and if
							Mother births and birth means nature, it‚Äôs fair to say there is little to no room of
							escaping the metaphor. But this
							is not about Mothers, it‚Äôs about womanhood and nature as a whole, <span class="spirit">it is
								about us.</span>
						</p>

						<p>Womanhood <em>‚Äúthe state or condition of being a woman, the qualities considered to be
								natural or characteristics
								of a woman, and women considered collectively‚Äù</em> and to be a woman? <em>‚ÄúAn adult
								female human being.‚Äù.</em>
							Great, thanks Google. But what does it mean to be female? The aim of this is not to discuss
							sex, gender, binary or
							the non-binary, however, it is crucial we have mutual understanding ‚Äì between author and
							reader. Womanhood and the
							feeling of being woman does not have to do with what is defined as biological sex. To be
							women does not mean to be
							female, therefore, I choose to reject the google definition of women. Yet it is crucial to
							acknowledge the base of
							research that grounds the stereotypes are based on women with wombs. This is an effort to
							reclaim the meaning of
							women and womanhood.</p>

						<p>Let‚Äôs visit our friends Eve and Adam, most of us know the story; Eve ate an apple (pardon me
							- forbidden fruit of
							the tree of knowledge and good and evil) because a serpent convinced her (stupid snake), and
							Adam followed not long
							after. God ‚Äì of course ‚Äì found out because ‚ÄòHe‚Äô sees all, and ‚ÄòHe‚Äô punished the female body
							with bearing child, and
							excruciating pain at childbirth (labor), and the male body with the oh so very labor
							(ironic) intensive work of
							grooming the ‚Äòaccursed‚Äô grounds aka Earth. This can easily be explained as the birth of the
							patriarchy<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-6"

						<p>Whether we choose to believe the stories of the Bible or not, there have been people around
							for a long time, and
							somehow, we agreed on the discourse of the earliest tools humanity made were weapons. From
							the early Stone Age tools
							being hammerstones and sharp stone flake, to the advancement of the middle Stone Age with
							spears, awls and scrapers
							(Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program). The symbol of hunting and killing
							accompanied by the male
							hero<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
									&#x261E;</label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span
									class="sidenote">The archetype of the hero is a
									character who acts as a force of the greater good, defending those weaker than
									themselves to the point of
									self-sacrifice. They‚Äôre usually elevated above those around them in some way,
									whether that‚Äôs through a
									superpower or magical advantage, or through an exemplary personal trait such as
									great courage or compassion
									(Callaghan).
									<br />
								</span></span>, the prey and the gasp-worthy story of the hunt. In her text, <em>The
								Carrier Bag Theory of
								Fiction</em>, Ursula K. Le Guin offers a rewrite of our narrative by proposing that the
							first tool was a tool for
							gathering, holding and containing, a recipient. Questioning the stereotypical role of
							survival, offering the
							narrative of humankind as gatherers and harvesters (women) rather than hunters and killers
							(men). I would propose
							this narrative has never been told due to the lack of tangible evidence, as I can only
							imagine the material of the
							recipients could not stand the test of time and have become lost evidence. <span
								class="spirit">She knows the souls and spirits from
								before your time. She knows neglect.</span> Maybe even our hands can be seen as the
							first recipients, but with that comes
							no great plot for storytelling. I choose to reject the killer story and embrace what has
							been neglected for too
							long, the steady story. The part which offers the recipient as the source of survival. The
							narrative of the
							gatherers.</p>

						<p><em>‚ÄúThe trouble is, we‚Äôve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may
								get finished along with
								it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words
								of the other story, the
								untold one, the life story.‚Äù</em> (Le Guin, 2). The relation of womanhood and nature is
							a bond we cannot neglect,
							yet we have become greatly separated from our ancestors, lost connection to the forest and
							the deep-rooted marks are
							feelings of emptiness I believe we seek fulfilment within. <span class="spirit">She knows

						<p>Before Christianity entered the waters of Denmark, it was mythological Goddesses and Gods
							from Norse Mythology

							myths serving as the
							fundament of the belief were communicated through odes<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label

							Norse mythology saw the
							world as enchanted, <span class="spirit">with no need to seek salvation,</span> and found
							peace living with nature, the enchanted forest and its
							spirits. <span class="spirit">Yet still not truly free.</span> A time where gatherers and
							the patriarchy coexisted. <span class="spirit">She was thriving. Running
								through the forests, swimming in the lakes.</span> As the world‚Äôs population grows, many
							seek the city high, and the
							closest we now get to living in an enchanted forest is the ‚Äòstupid walk for my stupid mental
							health‚Äô or our
							domesticated house plants, usually far from native to the land. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt know
							someone with a monstera
							living in the corner of their living room? (Guilty as charged).</p>

						<p>The Swedes and Norwegians have their mountains and what seems to be never-ending forests,
							where folklore and
							fairytales are thriving and spreading like fairy dust. Today in Denmark we don‚Äôt have the

									<br />
								</span></span> and I find myself asking: Where is the fairy dust? Don‚Äôt get me wrong,
							tales are told, stories are
							passed on, and we have a whole lot of coasts, but it seems the tales of the seas stayed with
							the sailors and never
							made it on land to stay. <span class="spirit">She is with us. Might seem long gone but she

							domesticated into agricultural land, and the forest which remains has been suffocated from
							all mystery and magic.
							<span class="spirit">Brewing by the shores, deep in the soil by the roots of the
								trees.</span> The vast majority of our forests have been
							tampered with, whether it is due to monoculture or storm secure, the Danish wilderness is
							far from wild. <span class="spirit">No place
								left to run.</span> Whilst the enchanted forests turned into agricultural masses of land
							and waved goodbye to its magic,
							the oppression of women continued to thrive. This is not an issue specific to Denmark, it is
							a concern throughout
							the world, Denmark is just such a beautiful example.

						<p>The article published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications LTD.,
							is based on deep
							analysis of runestones, by utilizing 3D scanning to study carving patterns through rhythm,
							combined with
							geographical distribution, orthography and language usage. <em>‚ÄúThe mentioning of Thyra on
								no fewer than four
								runestones is unparalleled in Viking-Age Denmark. In comparison, it is remarkable that
								Gorm is named on only a
								single stone ‚Äì and there accompanied by Thyra. Not even her famous son, Harald
								Bluetooth, is mentioned on that
								many stones.‚Äù</em> (Ibid). To my understanding the objective has been to establish a
							greater likelihood that the
							Thyra mentioned on four runestones was indeed the same and not two different women. It makes
							me wonder why it has
							been so hard to accept the conspiracy of it being the same woman in the first place. There
							is great uncertainty
							about the persona of Gorm, so why has it seemed so distant to hypothesize Thyra as a woman
							with great power?
							Hypothetical answer: the patriarchy. It seems very plausible that women of power have been
							disregarded and written
							out of our history to allow for the continuation of the hero narrative.</p>

						<p>I believe it is about the discourse of what we choose to accept, and if we choose to accept
							the runestones as
							<em>‚Äúgranite manifestation of status, lineage and power, we may suggest that Thyra was
								indeed of royal, Jutlandic
								descent.‚Äù</em> (Ibid)<span class="smallcaps">.</span> This discovery has allowed for
							reconsideration of the role
							of the elite Viking women who possibly held significant political power. Lisbeth M. Imer,
							researcher and author with
							a specialism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance says; <em>"we shouldn't rule out the
								possibility of women being able
								to hold power in their own right.".</em> Having women of the elite have the ability to
							own land is nothing new in
							Western Europe, however now Denmark can be added to the list and the collective history of
							the country needs to be
							rewritten. <span class="spirit">A speck of hope?</span> We ‚Äòknow‚Äô Gorm was said to be a
							stranger King, and this only fuels the hypothesis of
							Thyra being a powerful woman, a potential owner of large land mass. Could it in fact be
							their joint forces which put
							Gorm in the position of becoming King? We can only hypothesize, however given how much is
							based on hypothesis and
							here say, this is groundbreaking in terms of the women‚Äôs influence, which has never been
							considered or taken

						<p>It is remarkable that Denmark‚Äôs existence and big political moves could very well be due to
							two women. If we choose

							greater role of in the
							unification of kingdoms of Denmark than we thought.</p>

						<p>We now claim space for women to be written into our collective history at a time filled with
							savages, looting,
							killing and the thriving narrative of the hero. This rewrite of history does not mean the
							narrative of the gatherers
							does not remain for the common folk, after all the spirits and the enchanted forest were
							still there. Let me
							hypothesize; to compete with the elite domination of the hero, the Mother has had to hide ‚Äì
							disregard the narrative
							of the gatherer and the longing for the enchanted forest. They have had to put themselves in
							a position of
							authority, and if authority is man, then how do we rewrite the narrative so strongly imposed
							for the position of the
							women? <span class="spirit">She is furious. Furious in silence. By your side but you don‚Äôt
								see her.</span> The elite woman has had to claim
							space, already in a position of authority, allowing protection compared to the common woman
							‚Äì this does not by any
							means mean it was easy. Besides from the authority of the Mother (or more so marriage (so
							the authority of the man),
							because who dared to give birth without a husband?!), how does one tackle the authority of
							the hero? Speaking up.
							Being a woman with a voice often ‚Äì even to this day ‚Äì lands you in the stereotype of loud,
							obnoxious and irritating,
							yet somehow it seems that we have made no archetype for ‚Äòthat‚Äô type of person. But ‚Äòwe‚Äô sure
							have found a word we
							like to use: Hysterical. <span class="spirit">Let the brewing begin.</span></p>

						<h3 class="chapter-head" id="chapter-4">Hysteria and witchcraft
							<span class="mobile-only-text">Thought 4: Hysteria and witchcraft</span>
						</h3>
						<p>Hysteria has a loaded history, worthy a whole thesis, and has been used as a tool to control
							women‚Äôs behavior and
							bodies, causing countless misdiagnoses and violet mishandling of trauma throughout our time.
							The Danish vocabulary
							even has a word for the so-called ‚Äòhysterical woman‚Äô: <em>Hystade</em>, which to this day is
							used derogatorily
							towards women. Hysteria comes from the Greek <em>Hysteria</em> which means womb. Originally
							it was defined as a
							neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunctional uterus
							(‚ÄúHysteria | Etymology of
							Hysteria by Etymonline.‚Äù). Individuals with wombs have different hormonal cycles compared to
							individuals without
							wombs, to be more precise; an individual with a womb‚Äôs cycle is about 28 days, whereas an
							individual without a womb?
							24 hours (Verhofstede). Let me paint you a picture, it might not be fully scientifically
							true, however this is where
							my logic brings me; if being moody and irritable is only a percentage of the cycle, that
							means womb carriers have
							mood swings which can last a couple of days, where for the none-womb carriers it might just
							be a hot minute, and we
							move on. No wonder men didn‚Äôt know what was going on, there were very few womb-carriers
							voices being heard, so to
							diagnose women with the ‚Äòissue‚Äô of literally being a woman, probably seemed very legitimate
							from their perspective.
						</p>

						<p>An era which has been marked as the era of mass hysteria in Europe is the end of the
							16<sup>th</sup> century ‚Äì the
							witch hunts. <span class="spirit">The hunt of the few wild-spirited women.</span> Denmark
							was no exception. This is one of the many pivotal
							moments for women. As a society which has survived based on gatherers and harvesters, the
							patriarchy found a way of
							scaring women out of the enchanted forest. In 1917, King Christian the 4<sup>th</sup>
							prohibited all types of
							practice of magic, both black and white magic ‚Äì good and evil ‚Äì by deeming practicing a
							crime, and all Danes had the
							responsibility to raise trials (God). <span class="spirit">Silence.</span> Based on the
							remaining documentation, around 1,000 people were killed
							under conspiracy, and I believe along with them died the thousands of years of gathering
							knowledge which had been
							passed down through generations. <span class="spirit">A silent discomfort.</span> An
							educated woman of her time might have had great knowledge
							about harvesting and gathering, and I would not be surprised if those were the exact women
							who were first in line
							for the witch trials.</p>

						<p>This hunt is gruesome in so many ways which can never be fully comprehendible, and yet as we
							speak about it, we
							forget to address the years it put women back in society. I believe it is in this time of
							history in the West, where
							it becomes far beyond reasonable doubt to hypothesize that the oppression of women and the
							domination of the forest
							is due to the patriarchy. Let me explain; the fear of setting foot in the forest, harvesting
							items of potential
							suspicion, and being a little ‚Äòtoo‚Äô independent could immediately get you burnt at the
							stake. Women were bound to
							the walls of the ones lucky enough to have a roof over their heads, in fear for their life,
							and if this does not
							fall in under the definition of domesticated, I simply do not know what does. I would argue
							this fear is still in
							us, as a type of ancestral trauma (Santos). And the forest you might ask? Without women
							telling the fairytales,
							sharing years of knowledge as gatherers through time of the enchanted forests, it was left
							in the hands of the
							hunters. The gatherers narrative was pushed out of our collective story by the hero‚Äôs
							narrative. What once was the
							enchanted forest became the forest of wilderness, with animals either to be killed or
							domesticated. Either way, the
							forest was now in the hands of mankind (read; man). The few that did wander out into the
							forest most likely made
							sure to never mention the power of the herbs around them too loudly every again. <span

						<h3 class="chapter-head" id="chapter-5">The wild woman and a nationwide wolf hunt</h3>


						<p>As a revival of the archetypes, the wild woman was introduced by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s in
							1992 in her book
							<em>Women who run with the wolves.</em> The wild woman has untangled herself from the norms
							imposed by the
							patriarchy and relearnt to embody her true instincts and intuition. She is a powerful
							source; creative, spontaneous,
							courageous, sensual, unapologetic, untamed<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16"
									class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"> &#x261E;</label><input type="checkbox"
									id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Untamed means not
									domesticated or
									otherwise controlled.
									<br />
								</span></span> and with a deep connection to nature. The independent fairytale-like
							women society has deemed as
							mythical creatures. The woman we have been taught to be afraid of. <span class="spirit">Be
								careful! She might swallow you whole.</span> She is
							the woman who has escaped domestication. I choose the word ‚Äòrevival‚Äô because I believe this
							archetype of women has
							been around and we have been suppressing them through generations. <span class="spirit">Open
								the cage. Let her out.</span>
						</p>

						<p>Est√©s draws parallels between the wild woman and wolves through myths and storytelling,
							arguing we share similar
							autonomy. <em>‚ÄúThey are experiences in adapting to constantly changing circumstances; they
								are fiercely stalwart and
								very brave. Yet both have been hounded, harassed and falsely imputed to be devouring and
								devious, overly
								aggressive, or less value than those who are their detractors. They have been targeted
								of those who would clean up
								the wilds as well as the wildish environs of the psyche, extincting the instinctual,
								leaving no trace of it
								behind.‚Äù</em> (EsteÃÅs, 2).</p>

						<p>Ironically enough the ‚Äúlast‚Äù wolf to roam the Danish forests dates back to 1824, and with the
							last wolf passing we
							had eliminated the only true wild thread on the Danish land, besides from falling trees and
							our fellow humans
							(‚ÄúWolves Return To Denmark.‚Äù). After 1625 which marks the ‚Äòofficial‚Äô end to the witch trials
							in Denmark, the forest
							was a wild place for a while. A hunting ground. It wasn‚Äôt long till the ‚Äòneed‚Äô for taming
							the forest became the goal
							of the hunters, and with the wolf as the only larger threat to society it became the target.
							After the forced
							extinction of the wolf, the only threats were the occasional fox stealing chickens and one
							poisonous snake. We put
							mankind (read; man) at the top of the rank and empowered the image of the hunters. The hero
							narrative once again -
							fueled. If there is no direct threat from nature, we lack respect especially because we have
							become too detached. It
							isn‚Äôt until we are faced with fear we tread carefully.</p>

						<p>The wolf is now returning to Denmark. After 199 years, in 2013 the first wolf was sighted,
							and in 2017 the first
							pack was established by a female wolf which wandered over the border from Germany (Ibid).
							Now, approximately 80
							wolves are roaming the forests of Denmark. I believe we should let this be a sign of the
							returning wild woman within
							us. Let‚Äôs embrace the autonomy of decision making. <span class="spirit">Dig her out.</span>
							It‚Äôs about time we run over the border within our
							minds and change the narrative that so desperately needs to be rewritten. Relearn to trust
							our intuition and
							instincts as women in a society where we for generations have been told to do the opposite.
							There is a danger in
							acknowledging dualism between women‚Äôs oppression and the domination of nature (Plumwood),
							because by neglecting the
							decadency and on nature, one also neglects the narrative of the gatherers, witches and wild
							women within us. As
							humans we seek patterns, understanding and recognition within others. We seek a pack, a
							human instinct we have not
							fully neglected yet. We are pack animals that seek comfort, an escape from the fear of
							loneliness, and for a better
							chance of survival, but can a lone wolf thrive? No, but it can survive well on its own until
							it finds the right
							pack.</p>

						</div>
						<h3 class="chapter-head" id="chapter-6">Tying my thoughts together</h3>

						<p>Is there a way in which we can learn to lose the connection between womanhood and hysteria?
							Can we turn our
							Collective Unconscious, conscious and acknowledge the lack of understanding and recognition
							of women? Can we
							introduce new archetypes which have yet to be accepted into our conscious and blend into the
							unconscious? Can we
							gain a deep understanding of who we are as women outside the patriarchy whilst still living
							in it? You don‚Äôt have to
							go roll in dirt, heck you don‚Äôt have to hug a tree, but have you tried? A lil tree huggin‚Äô
							never hurt nobody. Seek
							comfort from the collective of womanhood, find your pack of people. There are ways in which
							we can find comfort and
							reconnect with our inner selves. What exactly this means for you I cannot say, it is
							something bigger than either of
							us. I believe truly only you can be the judge of what this means to you, whether you are the
							carrier of a womb or
							not.</p>

						<p>The discourse of how we have understood the position of women through time has to change. We
							must understand the
							importance of how storytelling has shaped our history, and how the narratives of women have
							been twisted into
							silence. The narrative of the gatherers was taken over by the hero, the enchanted forest‚Äôs
							spirits, Goddesses and
							Gods were replaced with the story of Eve and Adam and the need of salvation, our rich
							knowledge of the forest vastly
							disappeared during the witch hunts, and we are now at a point of attempting to revive the
							archetypes through
							storytelling to change the trajectory of our collective narrative.</p>

						<p>If we are to enter into conversation about nature criticism, the lack of acknowledgment
							between the ties of
							womanhood and nature has to be brought out from the deep dark area of neglect and into the
							light. It is a matter of
							allowing space for a new way of thinking and hypothesizing about how we behave as humans. A
							way of thinking which is
							not gendered, whilst still acknowledging biological differences, one which allows both the
							masculine and the
							feminine to be a part. It will have to do with a cultural shift of reclaiming meaning and
							challenging commonly
							accepted definitions and facts. Language is ever evolving so shouldn‚Äôt our narrative be as
							well? Can we find a way
							of disconnecting the masculine with the male and the feminine with female, loose the
							derogatory quotations attached,
							or are we beyond the point of no return in more than one way? Can we create new groundwork
							for collective healing?
						</p>

						<p>The goal is to move towards a normalization of autonomy in choice of behavior without the
							fear of judgement and
							neglect. Disregarding the derogatory gender norms and break way with the harsh shell of
							protection which we seek
							cover within. To move towards an understanding of the narrative of the gatherers, we need a
							seriously good
							paradigm-shift (if not multiple) in order to move above the archetypes which currently brew
							in our collective
							un/conscious. Afterall, it turns out my thoughts are not as entangled as anticipated. <span
