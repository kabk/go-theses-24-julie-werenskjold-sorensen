  <h3 id="research-question">Research Question</h3>

  <p>How can different areas of knowledge help provide understanding in the drift of the entanglement of womanhood and
    the enchanted forest, with roots in the Danish Landscape, whilst being a topic of discussion within Nature
    Criticism? </p>



  <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

  <p>This thesis embarks on a travel through my wandering thoughts on the entanglement of womanhood and the enchanted
    forest, specifically within the landscape of Denmark. With Nature Criticism as a starting point, I offer ecofeminism
    as a crucial branch of conversation. </p>

  <p>To trace the evolution of women’s narrative, I explore historical roots through mythology and language, whilst
    challenging the narrative of today, which has been determined by the patriarchy. I shed light on the overlooked role
    of women in the Danish Monarchy, whilst offering a reevaluation of historical events, to gain a deeper level of
    understanding of women’s agency and position in society. By addressing the concept of hysteria, the thesis examines
    how social norms have pathologized women, brewed awful stereotypes, and hindered the autonomy of choice. The
    witch-hunts serve as a reminder of the systemic oppression faced by women who deviated from the
    patriarchy. Additionally, parallels are drawn between the archetype of the wild woman and the national wolf hunts.
    With the wolves returning to the Danish forests, and reclaiming their territory, I argue to let this be a symbol of
    liberation from societal contains and a reconnection with our suppressed instincts. </p>

  <p>I leave you hanging with questions of what tomorrow looks like, what our next steps are as a society, and which
    directions our archetypes could take. By reclaiming forgotten narratives, and challenging the patriarchy, to embrace
    the autonomy of choice, I advocate for a future with a paradigm shift(s). Where the entanglement between the
    domination of women and nature are recognized, so we can establish new groundwork for collective healing. </p>



  <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

  <p>Let me start out like so many others; we live in a fast-paced world bla bla bla. We diverted from the path without
    looking up, technology took off, yet somehow we still patiently await the flying car. I want to disregard the good
    and the bad of technology, go back to before we diverted, and put human and nature back in focus.</p>

  <p>The Danish book <em>Ny Jord – Tidskrift for Naturkritik (New Earth: Journal of Nature Criticism)</em> by Peter
    Meedom and Jeppe Sengupta Carstensen, came to life based on a desire to establish a new critical concept – Nature
    Criticism<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-0" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Nature Criticism explored the
        connection between humans and nature, whilst viewing the two as inseparable entities.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span>. <em>“The preconditions for nature criticism, we believe, are once and for all to move beyond the
      idea that human beings and nature are separated or can in any way be kept apart.”</em> (Meedom)<span
      class="smallcaps">.</span> I want to add to this conversation by bringing ecofeminism<span
      class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
        id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Ecofeminism is a branch of feminism which examines the
        connection between women and nature. Its name was first coined in 1974 by French feminist Françoise d’Eaubonne.
        It used the basic feminist tenets of equality between genders, a revaluing of non-patriarchal or nonlinear
        structures, and a view of the world that respects organic processes, holistic connections, and the merit of
        intuition and collaboration (Miles).<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> to the table as a hot topic, because just like we can’t separate the human from nature, we can’t
    separate women’s oppression from the domination of nature.</p>

  <p>‘Mother Nature’ is thrown around without hesitation, yet somehow down the line we forgot what that embodies. The
    personification of nature has deep roots entangled with the image of the Mother, and within the patriarchal
    world<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Patriarchy refers to the greater
        aggregate power that men have over women and further genders, in terms of social, political, economic and
        hierarchies of power between individual men and groups of men (Strid, and Hearn).<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> the understanding of womanhood and the mother has been welded together. This type of thinking has
    ties to our culture, our ancestry and the Collective Unconscious, and with the Danes’ mindset turning more and more
    individualistic, I will through various ways of thinking, lay the groundwork to explore the evolution of womanhood
    and the interrelations to the enchanted forest. With the forest as a symbol of nature, I will focus on the Danish
    landscape, with the aim of understanding when this deep entanglement started to drift apart. Through historical
    roots, mythology, Queens of the Monarchy, Hysteria, and a nationwide wolf hunt I will offer a brief insight into the
    wilderness of my entangled thoughts of the Danish wild womanhood. Who is she?</p>

  <p>Along the way, many terms will be defined to assure we are on the same path<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label

    you hanging. I’m only human. Let your soul lead the way.</p>



  <h3 id="perspective-my-groundwork-of-understanding">Perspective: my groundwork of understanding </h3>

  <p>It’s important to note that my observations, judgments and thoughts are based on my heritage and upbringing in
    Denmark and Germany, as a white woman.</p>

  <p><strong><br />
    </strong></p>



  <h3 id="thought-1-a-network-of-historical-roots">Thought 1: A network of historical roots</h3>
  
  <p>We live in a part of the world designed and curated by white men for white men (Northern Europe), and with western
    patriarchy tightly knit with colonialism, deep-rooted marks have been left on a great deal of the world<span
      class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox"
        id="sn-4" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Whilst still noting there are matrilineal societies in
        the world to this day which have not been deeply westernized (Nelson).<br />
        <br />
      </span></span>. An example is how we perceive the meaning of womanhood, despite the occasional (read; widespread)
    ignorance, or as Carl Jung calls it; our Collective Unconscious. Which is the theory that a part of the mind
    contains memories and impulses, which are based on archetypical personalities that are perceived as universal
    symbols and representations of the common human experiences and emotions (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica).
    Key here is the unawareness of these instincts, which correlates well with the ideas that tend to disregard our
    ancestral experiences as sources of knowledge, a sense of guidance through the wild world.</p>
  
    <p>Languages, cultures and mythologies have through centuries personified Earth and Nature via the portrayal of the
    Mother and/or Goddesses<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-5"
        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-5" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote">To name a few; the Akan Mythology, Asase Ya, also known as Abrewa, in Sumerian Mythology;
        Nihursag, the Goddess Gaia from Greek Mythology, and in Norse Mythology, although not mentioned often in
        stories, the mother of Thor and Odin; Jörð old Norse for soil/earth.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span>. She flows through the trees, dances in the air, nurtures the ground and kisses your cheek with a
    breeze. Coincidentally the word nature is derived from the Latin <em>natura</em>, which in ancient times meant
    <em>birth</em>. The characteristic of the Mother archetype is nurturing, life-giving, a natural caretaker, and if
    Mother births and birth means nature, it’s fair to say there is little to no room of escaping the metaphor. But this
    is not about Mothers, it’s about womanhood and nature as a whole, it is about us.</p>
  
    <p>Womanhood <em>“the state or condition of being a woman, the qualities considered to be natural or characteristics
      of a woman, and women considered collectively”</em> and to be a woman? <em>“An adult female human being.”.</em>
    Great, thanks Google. But what does it mean to be female? The aim of this is not to discuss sex, gender, binary or
    the non-binary, however, it is crucial we have mutual understanding — between author and reader. Womanhood and the
    feeling of being woman does not have to do with what is defined as biological sex. To be women does not mean to be
    female, therefore, I choose to reject the google definition of women. Yet it is crucial to acknowledge the base of
    research that grounds the stereotypes are based on women with wombs. This is an effort to reclaim the meaning of
    women and womanhood.</p>
  
    <p>Let’s visit our friends Eve and Adam, most of us know the story; Eve ate an apple (pardon me - forbidden fruit of
    the tree of knowledge and good and evil) because a serpent convinced her (stupid snake), and Adam followed not long
    after. God - of course - found out because ‘He’ sees all, and ‘He’ punished the female body with bearing child, and
    excruciating pain at childbirth (labor), and the male body with the oh so very labor (ironic) intensive work of
    grooming the ‘accursed’ grounds aka Earth. This can easily be explained as the birth of the patriarchy<span

      <p>Whether we choose to believe the stories of the Bible or not, there have been people around for a long time, and
    somehow, we agreed on the discourse of the earliest tools humanity made were weapons. From the early Stone Age tools
    being hammerstones and sharp stone flake, to the advancement of the middle Stone Age with spears, awls and scrapers
    (Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program). The symbol of hunting and killing accompanied by the male
    hero<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-7" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">The archetype of the hero is a
        character who acts as a force of the greater good, defending those weaker than themselves to the point of
        self-sacrifice. They’re usually elevated above those around them in some way, whether that’s through a
        superpower or magical advantage, or through an exemplary personal trait such as great courage or compassion
        (Callaghan).<br />
        <br />
      </span></span>, the prey and the gasp-worthy story of the hunt. In her text, <em>The Carrier Bag Theory of
      Fiction</em>, Ursula K. Le Guin offers a rewrite of our narrative by proposing that the first tool was a tool for
    gathering, holding and containing, a recipient. Questioning the stereotypical role of survival, offering the
    narrative of humankind as gatherers and harvesters (women) rather than hunters and killers (men). I would propose
    this narrative has never been told due to the lack of tangible evidence, as I can only imagine the material of the
    recipients could not stand the test of time and have become lost evidence. She knows the souls and spirits from
    before your time. She knows neglect. Maybe even our hands can be seen as the first recipients, but with that comes
    no great plot for storytelling. I choose to reject the killer story and embrace what has been neglected for too
    long, the steady story. The part which offers the recipient as the source of survival. The narrative of the
    gatherers.</p>
  
    <p><em>“The trouble is, we’ve all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with
      it. Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the
      untold one, the life story.”</em> (Le Guin, 2). The relation of womanhood and nature is a bond we cannot neglect,
    yet we have become greatly separated from our ancestors, lost connection to the forest and the deep-rooted marks are
    feelings of emptiness I believe we seek fulfilment within. She knows the true wild woman.</p>

    forest</h3>
  
    <p>Before Christianity entered the waters of Denmark, it was mythological Goddesses and Gods from Norse Mythology
    which guided the people of the Viking era (McCoy, “Norse Mythology for Smart People.”). The myths serving as the
    fundament of the belief were communicated through odes<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-8"

        <br />
      </span></span>, passed down by our ancestors through tales and stories. The believers of Norse mythology saw the
    world as enchanted, with no need to seek salvation, and found peace living with nature, the enchanted forest and its
    spirits. Yet still not truly free. A time where gatherers and the patriarchy coexisted. She was thriving. Running
    through the forests, swimming in the lakes. As the world’s population grows, many seek the city high, and the
    closest we now get to living in an enchanted forest is the ‘stupid walk for my stupid mental health’ or our
    domesticated house plants, usually far from native to the land. I mean, who doesn’t know someone with a monstera
    living in the corner of their living room? (Guilty as charged).</p>
  
    <p>The Swedes and Norwegians have their mountains and what seems to be never-ending forests, where folklore and
    fairytales are thriving and spreading like fairy dust. Today in Denmark we don’t have the same scale of geographical
    features<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-10" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In my opinion Greenland and the Faroe
        Islands are not ours to claim.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> and I find myself asking: Where is the fairy dust? Don’t get me wrong, tales are told, stories are
    passed on, and we have a whole lot of coasts, but it seems the tales of the seas stayed with the sailors and never
    made it on land to stay. She is with us. Might seem long gone but she is there. Our enchanted forests have been
    domesticated into agricultural land, and the forest which remains has been suffocated from all mystery and magic.
    Brewing by the shores, deep in the soil by the roots of the trees. The vast majority of our forests have been
    tampered with, whether it is due to monoculture or storm secure, the Danish wilderness is far from wild. No place
    left to run. Whilst the enchanted forests turned into agricultural masses of land and waved goodbye to its magic,
    the oppression of women continued to thrive. This is not an issue specific to Denmark, it is a concern throughout
    the world, Denmark is just such a beautiful example.</p>
  
    <p>In Jelling you find the marked in King Harald Bluetooth’s runestone from 965, the declaration of Christianity
    (“Christianity Comes to Denmark.”). Changing our mythology of how we view the world does not happen overnight, and
    the first Christian mission dates to around 710, meaning between the 6<sup>th</sup> century and the late
    10<sup>th</sup> century, Christianity found a way to gradually co-exist with the Nordic Goddesses and Gods. Over
    time Christianity pushed the spirits out the way, where previously we found peace with the wilderness of the forest,
    suddenly a promise of salvation was created, and we sought validation and acceptance through the church. What
    remained of her was left behind. Our ancestorial connection to the land started to drift as we no longer sought
    salvation within ourselves, and the myths of the Goddesses, Gods, spirits and the enchanted forest became tales told
    at night rather than a deeply rooted belief system.</p>

    <p>The Danish Kingdom is one of the oldest in Europe and the second oldest monarchy in the world, and the past two
    generations have experienced growing up with H.M. Queen Margrethe the 2<sup>nd</sup>’s New Year’s speech for the
    past 52 years. In 1387, Margrete the 1<sup>st</sup> was unofficially appointed as the first Queen with ruling
    power<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input
        type="checkbox" id="sn-11" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">“<em>No woman had ever reigned as
          Denmark’s queen, but Margaret didn’t let a few laws of succession stand in the way. She adopted her
          six-year-old nephew and had herself named the “sovereign lady” of Denmark and Norway. When the Swedish nobles
          agreed a month later to accept Margaret as their “rightful master,” they dubbed her “Lady King</em>”.” Through
        time, the term Lady King turned into a way of recognizing her abilities (Gottlieb, 221).<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> (“The Transition to Christianity - National Museum of Denmark.”). She unified Denmark, Norway and
    Sweden by the union of Kalmar, but recent discoveries found that she might not have been the first highly
    influential Queen of Denmark. Turning the time back to the gruesome actions, which we now know as the tales of the
    Vikings, we meet Gorm the Old and Queen Thyra<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-12"
        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-12" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote">Interesting to point out is the fact that Harald Bluetooth was the son of Thyra and Gorm, and
        some believe he was the first King of Denmark due to uncertainty of the land mass his parents ruled over,
        whereas others count his parents as the first King and Queen of the Kingdom of Denmark.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> who came to power around 936. The discourse of the regent couple until this point placed Gorm as
    the man in charge, however a new research article suggests that Thyra had far more power than previously considered,
    suggesting what we thought was fact might’ve been factoid<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-13"
        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-13" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote">Factoid is a piece of unreliable information that is reported and repeated so often that it
        becomes accepted as fact.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span>. In reality, we don’t know much with certainty about Gorm. Eleventh-century historian Adam of
    Bremen suggests he was a ‘Stranger King’ from Norway or Normandy. The late twelfth-century historians Sven Aggesen
    and Saxo Grammaticus have described Gorm’s as weak and lazy, whereas the Norwegian sagas believe him to be a
    talented warrior (Imer). The main source of documentation we have from their time are 250 runestones, and don’t get
    me wrong; there are many but not a whole bible worth of rocks - but the text sure is set in stone.</p>
  
    <p>The article published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications LTD., is based on deep
    analysis of runestones, by utilizing 3D scanning to study carving patterns through rhythm, combined with
    geographical distribution, orthography and language usage. <em>“The mentioning of Thyra on no fewer than four
      runestones is unparalleled in Viking-Age Denmark. In comparison, it is remarkable that Gorm is named on only a
      single stone — and there accompanied by Thyra. Not even her famous son, Harald Bluetooth, is mentioned on that
      many stones.”</em> (Ibid). To my understanding the objective has been to establish a greater likelihood that the
    Thyra mentioned on four runestones was indeed the same and not two different women. It makes me wonder why it has
    been so hard to accept the conspiracy of it being the same woman in the first place. There is great uncertainty
    about the persona of Gorm, so why has it seemed so distant to hypothesize Thyra as a woman with great power?
    Hypothetical answer: the patriarchy. It seems very plausible that women of power have been disregarded and written
    out of our history to allow for the continuation of the hero narrative.</p>
  
    <p>I believe it is about the discourse of what we choose to accept, and if we choose to accept the runestones as
    <em>“granite manifestation of status, lineage and power, we may suggest that Thyra was indeed of royal, Jutlandic
      descent.”</em> (Ibid)<span class="smallcaps">.</span> This discovery has allowed for reconsideration of the role
    of the elite Viking women who possibly held significant political power. Lisbeth M. Imer, researcher and author with
    a specialism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance says; <em>"we shouldn't rule out the possibility of women being able
      to hold power in their own right.".</em> Having women of the elite have the ability to own land is nothing new in
    Western Europe, however now Denmark can be added to the list and the collective history of the country needs to be
    rewritten. A speck of hope? We ‘know’ Gorm was said to be a stranger King, and this only fuels the hypothesis of
    Thyra being a powerful woman, a potential owner of large land mass. Could it in fact be their joint forces which put
    Gorm in the position of becoming King? We can only hypothesize, however given how much is based on hypothesis and
    here say, this is groundbreaking in terms of the women’s influence, which has never been considered or taken
    seriously.</p>
  
    <p>Something which persists today is the idea that to sit on a solid fortune you rely on a workforce, introducing

    Britain and Ireland, with the intention of conquering the four Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms of England. Being successful and
    conquering great areas of land, the ruling law became the Danelaw, whether what I am about to tell you was
    Anglo-Saxon law before or after the Danelaw, I am uncertain of, however, it is referred to as the Anglo-Saxon law
    and it allowed for women serfs to rule “their own” land (Federici). This does not mean men and women were seen as
    equals, the owner/employer/lord of the land had the authority to control the women serfs’ lives, in terms of work
    and marriage (Ibid). Gatherers but domesticated.</p>
  
    <p>It is remarkable that Denmark’s existence and big political moves could very well be due to two women. If we choose
    to accept the new findings as our narrative and discourse it means Queen Thyra played a much greater role of in the
    unification of kingdoms of Denmark than we thought.</p>
  
    <p>We now claim space for women to be written into our collective history at a time filled with savages, looting,
    killing and the thriving narrative of the hero. This rewrite of history does not mean the narrative of the gatherers
    does not remain for the common folk, after all the spirits and the enchanted forest were still there. Let me
    hypothesize; to compete with the elite domination of the hero, the Mother has had to hide – disregard the narrative
    of the gatherer and the longing for the enchanted forest. They have had to put themselves in a position of
    authority, and if authority is man, then how do we rewrite the narrative so strongly imposed for the position of the
    women? She is furious. Furious in silence. By your side but you don’t see her. The elite woman has had to claim
    space, already in a position of authority, allowing protection compared to the common woman – this does not by any
    means mean it was easy. Besides from the authority of the Mother (or more so marriage (so the authority of the man),
    because who dared to give birth without a husband?!), how does one tackle the authority of the hero? Speaking up.
    Being a woman with a voice often – even to this day – lands you in the stereotype of loud, obnoxious and irritating,
    yet somehow it seems that we have made no archetype for ‘that’ type of person. But ‘we’ sure have found a word we
    like to use: Hysterical. Let the brewing begin.</p>

    <h3 id="thought-4-hysteria-and-witchcraft">Thought 4: Hysteria and witchcraft</h3>
  
    <p>Hysteria has a loaded history, worthy a whole thesis, and has been used as a tool to control women’s behavior and
    bodies, causing countless misdiagnoses and violet mishandling of trauma throughout our time. The Danish vocabulary
    even has a word for the so-called ‘hysterical woman’: <em>Hystade</em>, which to this day is used derogatorily
    towards women. Hysteria comes from the Greek <em>Hysteria</em> which means womb. Originally it was defined as a
    neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunctional uterus (“Hysteria | Etymology of
    Hysteria by Etymonline.”). Individuals with wombs have different hormonal cycles compared to individuals without
    wombs, to be more precise; an individual with a womb’s cycle is about 28 days, whereas an individual without a womb?
    24 hours (Verhofstede). Let me paint you a picture, it might not be fully scientifically true, however this is where
    my logic brings me; if being moody and irritable is only a percentage of the cycle, that means womb carriers have
    mood swings which can last a couple of days, where for the none-womb carriers it might just be a hot minute, and we
    move on. No wonder men didn’t know what was going on, there were very few womb-carriers voices being heard, so to
    diagnose women with the ‘issue’ of literally being a woman, probably seemed very legitimate from their perspective.
  </p>
  
  <p>An era which has been marked as the era of mass hysteria in Europe is the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century – the
    witch hunts. The hunt of the few wild-spirited women. Denmark was no exception. This is one of the many pivotal
    moments for women. As a society which has survived based on gatherers and harvesters, the patriarchy found a way of
    scaring women out of the enchanted forest. In 1917, King Christian the 4<sup>th</sup> prohibited all types of
    practice of magic, both black and white magic – good and evil – by deeming practicing a crime, and all Danes had the
    responsibility to raise trials (God). Silence. Based on the remaining documentation, around 1,000 people were killed
    under conspiracy, and I believe along with them died the thousands of years of gathering knowledge which had been
    passed down through generations. A silent discomfort. An educated woman of her time might have had great knowledge
    about harvesting and gathering, and I would not be surprised if those were the exact women who were first in line
    for the witch trials.</p>
  
    <p>This hunt is gruesome in so many ways which can never be fully comprehendible, and yet as we speak about it, we
    forget to address the years it put women back in society. I believe it is in this time of history in the West, where
    it becomes far beyond reasonable doubt to hypothesize that the oppression of women and the domination of the forest
    is due to the patriarchy. Let me explain; the fear of setting foot in the forest, harvesting items of potential
    suspicion, and being a little ‘too’ independent could immediately get you burnt at the stake. Women were bound to
    the walls of the ones lucky enough to have a roof over their heads, in fear for their life, and if this does not
    fall in under the definition of domesticated, I simply do not know what does. I would argue this fear is still in
    us, as a type of ancestral trauma (Santos). And the forest you might ask? Without women telling the fairytales,
    sharing years of knowledge as gatherers through time of the enchanted forests, it was left in the hands of the
    hunters. The gatherers narrative was pushed out of our collective story by the hero’s narrative. What once was the
    enchanted forest became the forest of wilderness, with animals either to be killed or domesticated. Either way, the
    forest was now in the hands of mankind (read; man). The few that did wander out into the forest most likely made
    sure to never mention the power of the herbs around them too loudly every again. The last enchanted traces. Kept
    locked in the memories of few.</p>

    <h3 id="thought-5-the-wild-woman-and-a-nationwide-wolf-hunt">Thought 5: The wild woman and a nationwide wolf hunt</h3>
  
    <p>As a revival of the archetypes, the wild woman was introduced by Clarissa Pinkola Estés in 1992 in her book
    <em>Women who run with the wolves.</em> The wild woman has untangled herself from the norms imposed by the
    patriarchy and relearnt to embody her true instincts and intuition. She is a powerful source; creative, spontaneous,
    courageous, sensual, unapologetic, untamed<span class="sidenote-wrapper"><label for="sn-16"
        class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-16" class="margin-toggle" /><span
        class="sidenote">Untamed means not domesticated or otherwise controlled.<br />
        <br />
      </span></span> and with a deep connection to nature. The independent fairytale-like women society has deemed as
    mythical creatures. The woman we have been taught to be afraid of. Be careful! She might swallow you whole. She is
    the woman who has escaped domestication. I choose the word ‘revival’ because I believe this archetype of women has
    been around and we have been suppressing them through generations. Open the cage. Let her out.</p>
  
    <p>Estés draws parallels between the wild woman and wolves through myths and storytelling, arguing we share similar
    autonomy. <em>“They are experiences in adapting to constantly changing circumstances; they are fiercely stalwart and
      very brave. Yet both have been hounded, harassed and falsely imputed to be devouring and devious, overly
      aggressive, or less value than those who are their detractors. They have been targeted of those who would clean up
      the wilds as well as the wildish environs of the psyche, extincting the instinctual, leaving no trace of it
      behind.”</em> (Estés, 2).</p>
  
      <p>Ironically enough the “last” wolf to roam the Danish forests dates back to 1824, and with the last wolf passing we
    had eliminated the only true wild thread on the Danish land, besides from falling trees and our fellow humans
    (“Wolves Return To Denmark.”). After 1625 which marks the ‘official’ end to the witch trials in Denmark, the forest
    was a wild place for a while. A hunting ground. It wasn’t long till the ‘need’ for taming the forest became the goal
    of the hunters, and with the wolf as the only larger threat to society it became the target. After the forced
    extinction of the wolf, the only threats were the occasional fox stealing chickens and one poisonous snake. We put
    mankind (read; man) at the top of the rank and empowered the image of the hunters. The hero narrative once again -
    fueled. If there is no direct threat from nature, we lack respect especially because we have become too detached. It
    isn’t until we are faced with fear we tread carefully.</p>
  
    <p>The wolf is now returning to Denmark. After 199 years, in 2013 the first wolf was sighted, and in 2017 the first
    pack was established by a female wolf which wandered over the border from Germany (Ibid). Now, approximately 80
    wolves are roaming the forests of Denmark. I believe we should let this be a sign of the returning wild woman within
    us. Let’s embrace the autonomy of decision making. Dig her out. It’s about time we run over the border within our
    minds and change the narrative that so desperately needs to be rewritten. Relearn to trust our intuition and
    instincts as women in a society where we for generations have been told to do the opposite. There is a danger in
    acknowledging dualism between women’s oppression and the domination of nature (Plumwood), because by neglecting the
    decadency and on nature, one also neglects the narrative of the gatherers, witches and wild women within us. As
    humans we seek patterns, understanding and recognition within others. We seek a pack, a human instinct we have not
    fully neglected yet. We are pack animals that seek comfort, an escape from the fear of loneliness, and for a better
    chance of survival, but can a lone wolf thrive? No, but it can survive well on its own until it finds the right
    pack.</p>
  
    <p><strong><br />

    <h3 id="concluding-thought-tying-my-thoughts-together">Concluding thought; Tying my thoughts together</h3>
  
    <p>Is there a way in which we can learn to lose the connection between womanhood and hysteria? Can we turn our
    Collective Unconscious, conscious and acknowledge the lack of understanding and recognition of women? Can we
    introduce new archetypes which have yet to be accepted into our conscious and blend into the unconscious? Can we
    gain a deep understanding of who we are as women outside the patriarchy whilst still living in it? You don’t have to
    go roll in dirt, heck you don’t have to hug a tree, but have you tried? A lil tree huggin’ never hurt nobody. Seek
    comfort from the collective of womanhood, find your pack of people. There are ways in which we can find comfort and
    reconnect with our inner selves. What exactly this means for you I cannot say, it is something bigger than either of
    us. I believe truly only you can be the judge of what this means to you, whether you are the carrier of a womb or
    not.</p>
  
    <p>The discourse of how we have understood the position of women through time has to change. We must understand the
    importance of how storytelling has shaped our history, and how the narratives of women have been twisted into
    silence. The narrative of the gatherers was taken over by the hero, the enchanted forest’s spirits, Goddesses and
    Gods were replaced with the story of Eve and Adam and the need of salvation, our rich knowledge of the forest vastly
    disappeared during the witch hunts, and we are now at a point of attempting to revive the archetypes through
    storytelling to change the trajectory of our collective narrative.</p>
  
    <p>If we are to enter into conversation about nature criticism, the lack of acknowledgment between the ties of
    womanhood and nature has to be brought out from the deep dark area of neglect and into the light. It is a matter of
    allowing space for a new way of thinking and hypothesizing about how we behave as humans. A way of thinking which is
    not gendered, whilst still acknowledging biological differences, one which allows both the masculine and the
    feminine to be a part. It will have to do with a cultural shift of reclaiming meaning and challenging commonly
    accepted definitions and facts. Language is ever evolving so shouldn’t our narrative be as well? Can we find a way
    of disconnecting the masculine with the male and the feminine with female, loose the derogatory quotations attached,
    or are we beyond the point of no return in more than one way? Can we create new groundwork for collective healing?
  </p>
  
  <p>The goal is to move towards a normalization of autonomy in choice of behavior without the fear of judgement and
    neglect. Disregarding the derogatory gender norms and break way with the harsh shell of protection which we seek
    cover within. To move towards an understanding of the narrative of the gatherers, we need a seriously good
    paradigm-shift (if not multiple) in order to move above the archetypes which currently brew in our collective
    un/conscious. Afterall, it turns out my thoughts are not as entangled as anticipated. Who is she? I don’t know, you
    will have to see for yourself.</p>
